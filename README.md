# An Experimental Comparison of Evolved Neural Network Models for Controlling Simulated Modular Soft Robots

Repository for the paper "An Experimental Comparison of Neural Models for Controlling Evolved Modular Soft Robots".

Based on:
- [JGEA](https://github.com/ericmedvet/jgea), for the evolutionary optimization
- [2D-VSR-Sim](https://github.com/ericmedvet/2dhmsr), for the simulation of VSRs
